## FireCMS Content Management System

### Why FireCMS Makes Development Easier

**Schema-Driven Architecture**
- Content models defined once in `cms.config.ts` auto-generate:
  - TypeScript interfaces
  - Database structure  
  - Admin forms
  - Validation rules
  - API endpoints

**Rapid Content Type Creation**
```typescript
// Adding a new content type takes minutes
const newsCollection = buildCollection({
  name: "News",
  path: "news", 
  properties: {
    title: buildProperty({ dataType: "string" }),
    content: buildProperty({ dataType: "string", markdown: true }),
    publishDate: buildProperty({ dataType: "date" })
  }
});
```

**Real-Time Updates**
- Content changes appear instantly across all devices
- No cache invalidation or manual refreshes needed
- Collaborative editing with live sync

**Non-Technical User Empowerment**
- Intuitive admin interface at `/admin`
- Drag-and-drop image uploads
- WYSIWYG markdown editing
- Publishing workflow with draft/live states

### Content Collections

**Portfolio Management** (`/portfolio`)
- Project showcase with categories (Art, Design, Branding)
- Multi-image galleries with Firebase Storage integration
- Publishing workflow for content control
- Automatic image optimization and responsive serving

**About Section** (`/about`)
- Markdown-supported content editing

- Structured content sections

**Contact Information** (`/contact`) 
- Business details with validation
- Social media link management
- Email configuration

**Site Settings** (`/settings`)
- SEO metadata management
- Branding assets (logos, favicons)
- Global site configuration

### CMS Configuration Details

The CMS is configured through `src/app/cms/cms.config.ts` which defines:

- **Portfolio Collection**: Manage portfolio items with categories and image galleries
- **About Collection**: Edit about page content with markdown support
- **Contact Collection**: Manage contact information and social media links
- **Settings Collection**: Control site-wide settings like SEO metadata

Each collection supports:
- **Custom Validation**: Field-level validation rules
- **Image Uploads**: Direct integration with Firebase Storage

- **Publishing Workflow**: Draft/published status for content

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Angular CLI 20.1.0
- Firebase CLI for deployment

### Quick Start

1. **Clone and Install**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tribeca-concepts-clone.git
cd tribeca-concepts-clone
npm install
```

2. **Firebase Project Setup**
```bash
# Install Firebase CLI if not already installed
npm install -g firebase-tools

# Login to Firebase
firebase login

# Create a new Firebase project or use existing one
firebase projects:create your-project-id

# Configure the project
firebase use --add your-project-id
```

3. **Environment Configuration**
```bash
# Run the setup script to configure Firebase credentials
./scripts/setup-firebase.sh
```

This script will:
- Prompt for your Firebase project credentials
- Ask for admin email addresses
- Generate `.env.production` file with your configuration
- Update `.firebaserc` with your project ID

4. **Start Development Environment**
```bash
# Start Firebase emulators
firebase emulators:start

# In another terminal, start the development server
ng serve
```

5. **Access the Application**
- **Public Site**: `http://localhost:4200/`
- **Admin Panel**: `http://localhost:4200/admin`
- **Firebase Emulator UI**: `http://localhost:4000/`

6. **Initial Admin Setup**
- Go to `http://localhost:4200/admin/login`
- Sign in with Google using one of your configured admin emails
- Start managing content through the CMS interface

### Firebase Emulator Configuration
- **Firestore**: localhost:8080
- **Storage**: localhost:9199
- **Authentication**: localhost:9099

### Development Workflow with Emulators

The development workflow uses Firebase emulators for local testing:

- **Data Persistence**: Emulator data is persisted in `emulator_data/` directory
- **Easy Reset**: Delete `emulator_data/` to start with a clean slate
- **Realistic Testing**: Emulators closely match production Firebase behavior
- **Offline Development**: Work without internet connectivity
- **Security Testing**: Test Firebase rules locally before deployment

### Environment Variable Injection

The project uses a template-based configuration system to securely manage environment variables:

- **Template Files**: Configuration templates are stored in `src/environments/*.template` and are tracked in version control
- **Environment Files**: Actual configuration files (`.env.production`, `.env.local`) contain sensitive data and are git-ignored
- **Injection Process**: During deployment, scripts inject real values from environment files into templates
- **Security**: Sensitive data never committed to the repository

### Meta Data Injection

Site metadata (title, description, keywords) is automatically injected from Firestore settings:

- **Template**: `src/index.html.template` contains placeholders for metadata
- **Injection**: `scripts/inject-meta.js` fetches settings from Firestore and generates `src/index.html`
- **Dynamic Updates**: Site metadata can be updated through the CMS without code changes

### Firebase Rules Generation

Firebase security rules are automatically generated with admin email whitelisting:

- **Templates**: `firestore.rules.template` and `storage.rules.template` contain placeholders
- **Generation**: `scripts/generate-rules.js` creates actual rules with injected admin emails
- **Consistency**: Same admin emails used across all security layers

### Admin Email Whitelisting

Admin access is controlled through email whitelisting for enhanced security:

- **Configuration**: Admin emails are configured during setup via `./scripts/setup-firebase.sh`
- **Injection**: Emails are automatically injected into Firebase rules and Angular environment files
- **Authentication**: Only whitelisted Google accounts can access the admin panel
- **Authorization**: Route protection and Firebase rules enforce admin-only access

### Deployment Process Details

The deployment process automates several important steps:

1. **Environment Validation**: Checks for required environment variables
2. **Rule Generation**: Creates Firebase rules with admin email injection
3. **Environment Injection**: Generates environment files from templates
4. **Meta Data Injection**: Fetches site settings from Firestore
5. **Build Process**: Compiles Angular application for production
6. **Validation**: Ensures build output meets requirements
7. **Deployment**: Deploys Firestore rules, Storage rules, and hosting
8. **Cleanup**: Removes sensitive environment variables from memory

### Angular Application Structure

The application follows a modular structure with clear separation of concerns:

- **Standalone Components**: Modern Angular approach using standalone components
- **Lazy Loading**: Routes are lazy-loaded for improved performance
- **Services**: Firebase integration is encapsulated in dedicated services
- **Guards**: Route protection using Angular guards
- **CMS Integration**: Custom FireCMS implementation for content management

## Testing

### Unit Testing with Jasmine and Karma

This project uses Jasmine as the testing framework and Karma as the test runner. Jasmine provides behavior-driven development (BDD) capabilities, while Karma runs tests in real browsers.

**Running Unit Tests**
```bash
# Run tests once
ng test

# Run tests in watch mode (re-runs on file changes)
ng test --watch

# Run tests with code coverage
ng test --code-coverage
```

**Test Configuration**
- **Karma**: Configured through Angular CLI in `angular.json` (test section)
- **Jasmine**: Specified in `tsconfig.spec.json` as the testing framework
- **Test Files**: All files with `.spec.ts` extension are automatically recognized as test files
- **Test Environment**: Runs in Chrome browser by default with headless option available

**Example Test Structure**
```typescript
import { TestBed } from '@angular/core/testing';
import { App } from './app';

describe('App Component', () => {
  beforeEach(async () => {
    // Configure testing module before each test
    await TestBed.configureTestingModule({
      imports: [App],
    }).compileComponents();
  });

  it('should create the app', () => {
    // Test individual functionality
    const fixture = TestBed.createComponent(App);
    const app = fixture.componentInstance;
    expect(app).toBeTruthy();
  });
});
```

**Key Testing Features**
- **Component Testing**: Test Angular components in isolation or with their templates
- **Service Testing**: Mock dependencies and test business logic
- **Asynchronous Testing**: Handle promises, observables, and HTTP requests
- **DOM Testing**: Verify component rendering and user interactions
- **Code Coverage**: Measure test coverage with detailed reports

### End-to-End Testing
```bash
ng e2e
```

### Testing Procedures

The project includes comprehensive testing capabilities:

- **Unit Testing**: Component and service testing with Jasmine and Karma
- **End-to-End Testing**: Integration testing with Protractor (if configured)
- **Emulator Testing**: Test Firebase rules and functions locally
- **Manual Testing**: Use Firebase Emulator UI for data inspection
- **Security Testing**: Validate Firebase rules with emulator testing

**Troubleshooting Test Errors**

If you encounter errors when running the test server, it may be due to:

1. **Template Mismatch**: The test expects specific DOM elements that don't exist in the actual template
2. **Missing Dependencies**: The App component depends on Firebase services that need to be mocked in tests
3. **Environment Configuration**: Tests may fail if they can't connect to Firebase emulators

To fix these issues, ensure that:
- Test files properly mock all external dependencies
- Test expectations match the actual component template
- Firebase services are properly stubbed in the testing environment
