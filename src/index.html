She studied Fine Art and Graphic Design in Tokyo and New York City and worked as a graphic designer in branding, marketing and print design in Tokyo and New York City. After more than 20 years in New York City, she moved to Zurich in 2015. Her artistic work is enriched by different cultural perspectives. Her work is inspired by natural structures, physical anatomy and emotional states. She often combines biological forms with various emotions and physical sensations through bold colours and organic shapes.",
